                             Rumi Narrative was born from a deep belief that storytelling rooted in truth, strategy, and
                            soul can shape culture, influence policy, and inspire action. Founded by Suleiman Amanzad, a
                            communications leader with over 15 years of experience across global institutions,
                            movements, and campaigns, RumiNarrative brings together poetic insight and strategic
                            precision. Drawing on a legacy that spans crisis communication, narrative change, advocacy,
                            and brand leadership from Kabul to Portland, we exist to help organizations, causes, and
                            companies clarify their voice, elevate their mission, and drive meaningful impact. At
                            RumiNarrative, we don’t just tell stories, we shape narratives that matter.</p>

                        <p class="about-text">
                            I’ve always believed that language is more than communication—it’s connection.
                            A way to carry truth. To build trust. To move people—not just toward action, but toward each
                            other. <br>
                            Over the past 15 years, I’ve worked across cultures, crises, and causes—helping
                            organizations find clarity in complexity, and voice in moments of change. I’ve led
                            communications in fragile contexts, built narrative strategies for global institutions, and
                            supported teams navigating uncertainty. But through it all, I’ve stayed anchored in one
                            simple belief: that every message can be an offering—if it’s shaped with care. <br><br>
                            I created <b>RumiNarrative</b> as a response to what I saw missing:
                            Communications that are not just strategic, but soulful.
                            Not just effective, but ethical.
                            Not just heard, but felt.

                            — Rumi

                            To leaders and movements.
                            To stories still becoming.

The effort brought together ministries, civil society, and media to frame a narrative of progress—from the turmoil of the early 2000s to a country working toward reform, resilience, and partnership.
